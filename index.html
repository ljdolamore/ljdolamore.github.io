<h5>Kathy Has Jokes Too!</h>
<ol>
<li>They say pimpin' aint easy, but what they don't tell you is being a prositute is much, much more difficult.</li>
<li>The Al Quaeda magazine has a recipe for a homemade pipe bomb, they also have a recipe for a pretty darn good peach cobbler.</li>
<li>I think being a lone wolf is one of the coolest things there is.  Until the wolf pinic happens and you don't have a partner for the wolf wheelbarrow race. </li>
<li>In my opinion if we are going to fight the "War on Terror,"we should start with this nation's Haunted Houses.</li>
<li>Kim and Kanye's first child, North, just celebrated her second birthday.  They celebrated with food, games, and even a ferris wheel.  The bad part? She's a baby and has no clue what the hell is going on.</li>
<li>It's getting pretty hard to watch The Flinstones now adays, with their stone age drive in movies and their caveman bowling alleys, it just feels so dated.</li>
